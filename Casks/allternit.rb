  caveats <<~EOS
    Allternit Desktop requires macOS 13+ (Ventura or later).

    On first launch, if Gatekeeper blocks the app, right-click Allternit Desktop
    in Applications and select "Open". This is normal until the app is fully
    notarized with Apple.

    The app includes an auto-updater that checks for new versions on launch.
